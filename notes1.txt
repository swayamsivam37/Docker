Docker is a container technology: a tool for creating and managing container.

container: a standarized unit of code and packages.

why containers? -> why we want independent , standarized "application packages".

1. development environment --> production environment
2. development environment for employee A --> development environment for employee B

virtual Machine / virtual OS:

pro:

con:
Redundant duplication , waste of space.
Performance can be slow , boot times can be long.
reproducing on another computer server is possible but may still be tricky.
